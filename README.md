# 🧑‍💻 Ankit Mishra — Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website — designed to be **minimal, intentional, and engineering-focused** rather than flashy.
It showcases my work, values, and experience, along with an **interactive Linux-style terminal experience** that reflects how I think as an engineer.

## 🎯 Goals of This Project

* Simple, clean and distraction-free UI
* Meaningful content, not buzzwords
* Subtle personality without gimmicks
* Explore UI + UX + Engineering mindset together
* Build something that feels *crafted*, not a template

---

## ✨ Features

### 🔥 Hero Section

* Clean introduction
* Subtle animations
* Professional presentation

### 📌 Projects Section

* Selected meaningful work
* Real engineering work (backend, drone systems, microservices)
* Not “just frontend apps”

### 👤 About Section

* Honest narrative
* Focus on mindset + purpose

### 💻 Interactive Terminal Mode

One of the main highlights.
A Linux-like terminal popup that lets users explore more about me via commands.

Feels real because of:

* blinking cursor
* shell prompt (`ankit@dev:~/portfolio$`)
* instant keyboard focus on open
* scroll behavior like real terminal
* Ctrl + C cancel behavior
* Linux-style error messages
* clean structured output formatting

## 🧵 Terminal Commands

```
help        → show all commands
about       → about me
mindset     → engineering principles
work        → what I like working on
projects    → selected projects list
stack       → tools & technologies I use
contact     → reach me
clear       → clear screen
exit        → close terminal
```

Designed to feel like a real CLI tool rather than a gimmick.
